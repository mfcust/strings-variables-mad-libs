# Variables
Learn how to use variables and strings!!


A variable is a storage container for a variable. What does that mean? It means that it represents whatever value you give it! This allows you to change the value, while keeping the variable itself the same. Let's look at an example:

  ```
  name = 'Sarah'
  print(name)
  ```
In this case, the name 'Sarah' will be printed to your console. You declare that the *variable* called name is equal to the *value* Sarah.

# Strings

By definition, a string is an array of characters. A character is a letter, number or symbol. Basically, anything on your keyboard can be considered a character *as long as it is in between double or single quotes.*
